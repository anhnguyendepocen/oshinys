> install.packages("/yourpath/oshinys_0.1-1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

or

> install.packages("~/yourpath/oshinys_0.1-1.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")

Then install the additional required packages from CRAN:

> install.packages("shiny")

> install.packages("deSolve")

> install.packages("scatterplot3d")

Onced you have done the first insallation you can LAUNCH any app -- for example the Rozenzweig-MacArthur model -- 
through Starting R or Rstudio and type:

This should start your browser with the shinyApp running. If you can't see any graphics make sure
